# Alpha model production release

Date: 4 October 2026. Follow-up to the website-only deployment.

The 13 retained booklets across 10 sets are packaged as **unverified_alpha**, with exact canonical scene/final Three.js PNG bindings and audited individual-part geometry. All 13 first/final snapshot views loaded through the public UI in a read-only loopback inspection; no JavaScript/HTTP errors, private API calls or PDF/crop fetches were observed. Desktop and phone plane and Rivendell views were inspected.

Publication remains pending the user's approval of these exact immutable hashes, as required by `docs/RELEASE_OPERATIONS.md`. All 13 bundles are privately staged; remote generations and byte hashes verified. The new website/runtime code has not yet been deployed. No approval records or public model assets have been created by this release task.

## Verification and limitations

- Local software: 472 backend tests, 48 frontend tests, 36 browser tests passed; 3 optional performance audits skipped. Schema, Ruff, typecheck and production build passed. Independent security review cleared the tightened PNG, licence, alias, selected-booklet and catalogue integrity gates. All 13 actual bundles passed again with unchanged hashes. The 3 focused alpha browser cases passed again after the final label/parser changes.
- Actual bundles: 5835 files, 217169038 bytes total. The largest is 21061/main, 57123196 bytes. Each release stays within 512MB/22000 files; the largest file count is 1061.
- Frozen scene/checkpoint digests and original final render hashes match. Official PDF bytes were rehashed against existing source pins. No part identities, placements, assembly review or physical-test outcomes were changed.
- Accuracy remains unverified. Human assembly review and physical build are `not_run`; connector/assembly checks remain unchecked. These are PDF-assisted alpha reconstructions, not automatic successes or reviewed tutorials. Rivendell later booklets preserve cumulative prefixes; geometry component counts are not certified retail piece totals.
- Public exports contain snapshots, actual viewport PNGs, individual part closure, typed disclosures, coverage/validation summaries and sanitized attribution. Official manuals/crops, completion reports, engine jobs, private paths and credentials remain private. DAT source bytes retain their original CC BY4.0 or dual2.0/4.0 notices. LDConfig rights are recorded from its actual receipt without inventing an in-file licence.
- Scope/cost: existing dedicated Guide2Build resources only; no provisioning or inference. Private staging and eventual public assets total 434338076 bytes. Transfers use 8 bounded workers; exact object generations/hashes and sequential compare-and-swap publication heads remain enforced. Existing min 0/max 1 Cloud Run and shared-project CHF8.26 budget alerts remain; alerts are not a hard billing cap.

## Evidence

- Exact releases and final scene/render bindings: `var/evidence/alpha-production/release-index.json`.
- Software logs: `software-check-verified.log`, `browser-software.log` in the same folder.
- Actual public UI inspection: `local-browser/report.json` and its 13 final desktop plus 2 phone screenshots.
- Security/cost plan: `security-cost-plan.json`; private transfer receipts: `staging-receipts.json`.
- The read-only inspection server at `http://127.0.0.1:4186/` makes these bundles reviewable without creating publication approval records. The existing local engine preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4175/` remains available.

Local large-booklet 3 inspection took 51.2 seconds from the start of lookup through both first and final loaded views. This is one observed loopback software QA sample with concurrent tests, not a GPU or network benchmark.

Production browser checks, exact-hash approval receipts and published catalogue heads will be added only after those operations actually occur.
